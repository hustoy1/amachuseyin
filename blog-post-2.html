        <h1>Ethical Issues Facing Engineers and their Profession</h1>

        <p>
            In the article <strong>Ethical Issues Facing Engineers and their Profession</strong>, the authors discuss the ethical considerations in engineering. They explore the following topics:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Current perceptions of ethics among engineers.</li>
            <li>Obstacles faced in promoting ethical conduct.</li>
            <li>The role of professional societies, like IEEE and ABET, in establishing and updating ethical standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            "The article emphasizes the importance of integrating ethics education into engineering curricula to better prepare young engineers for the ethical difficulties they may encounter in their careers."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is a great article where we can learn about the current environment of ethics in engineering. It provides many examples for a better understanding, and while reflecting on the mistakes that caused large problems in the past, it offers valuable lessons.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Points from the Article:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Case studies:</strong> Engineering schools can analyze real-world problems through case studies, allowing students to engage with real data.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic ethics:</strong> Engineering ethics must evolve with technological advancements. It's crucial to update the curriculum to reflect this.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This is especially true for older engineering schools like Purdue. I recall our dean mentioning that many institutions founded centuries ago face challenges in adapting to modern trends.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "We have AI now, and I believe our school is doing great in leading this new trend with updated policies and integrating AI into the learning experience."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Overall, the article makes a strong case for continuous updates in ethics education, ensuring that young engineers are equipped to handle new challenges.
