                <!-- Introduction -->
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>As artificial intelligence swiftly becomes an inseparable part of our lives, blending seamlessly into everything we do, conversations around its ethical implications have never been more pressing. At the same time, we’re becoming acutely aware of just how critical these ethical considerations are in shaping our future.</p>
<br>
                <h2>My Experience at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</h2>
                <p>In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to assist in an experiment at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using the 88-inch Cyclotron. This was an incredible experience that allowed me to gain valuable technical skills and knowledge. While there, I learned about the laboratory's history and was amazed to hear that, in the past, scientists would stay in the beam’s path to observe while it was active, despite the high risk of radiation exposure.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Today, however, strict safety procedures are in place to prevent harm. Before the beam room is closed, every corner must be thoroughly checked, and we must shout to ensure no one is inside. Tools used in the room must also be screened and held for two weeks before being shipped.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The Ethical Challenge of AI</h2>
                <p>The laboratory’s strict protocols arose from lessons learned through past mistakes. I think this is the situation we now face with AI. As a new and rapidly advancing technology, AI is being integrated into nearly every aspect of our lives, including engineering, and we are in the middle of a critical transition period. My concern is that AI is being implemented without fully considering its ethical implications, and this could lead to disastrous consequences.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>NSPE Code of Ethics:</strong> Engineers should “hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.” AI systems must be designed with ethics at their core.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In conclusion, while AI offers tremendous potential, we must ensure that its integration is carefully regulated and governed by ethical principles. Just as past experiences in laboratory safety have shaped better practices, we must proactively shape the future of AI in engineering to prevent harm and ensure the well-being of society.</p>
