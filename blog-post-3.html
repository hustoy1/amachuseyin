                <h1>Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, and Ethical Concerns in Data Privacy</h1>
                <p>Posted on October 5, 2024 | Hits: 320</p>
            </header>

            <section class="post-content">
                <!-- Introduction -->
                <p>In the 2010s, personal data belonging to millions of Facebook users was collected without their consent by the consulting company Cambridge Analytica for political advertising purposes. The data was used in major political events like the 2016 U.S. presidential campaigns and the Brexit referendum.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The data was collected from 87 million Facebook profiles and used for targeted political campaigns, raising significant ethical concerns about user privacy and data misuse."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Facebook was accused of violating the fundamental canon of <strong>"Avoid Deceptive Acts."</strong> The company misrepresented the purpose of the survey conducted and the deal made with Cambridge Analytica, putting user privacy at risk.</p>

                <h2>Management's Responsibility</h2>
                <p>I believe that the primary responsibility for this breach lies at the management level. While engineers developed the tools used, many may not have been aware of the broader implications. This raises an important ethical question: Should engineers be more involved in management decisions and policymaking?</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Engineers must be informed of how their work is being used. By doing so, we can avoid unethical decisions like those made in this scandal."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, companies have become more transparent about their data collection practices. You can see this change in action through the consent pop-ups we now encounter on nearly every website. However, as we approach the 2024 U.S. elections, it remains unclear how companies are collecting data today.</p>

                <h2>Reflections on Data Privacy Today</h2>
                <p>Although companies claim to have improved their policies, questions remain about how data is collected and used, especially with the significant changes happening on platforms like Twitter (now X).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Post-Cambridge Analytica:</strong> Data privacy regulations have tightened, but the enforcement remains inconsistent.</li>
                    <li><strong>2024 U.S. Elections:</strong> As we approach another election cycle, it's worth asking whether companies are still exploiting user data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engineerâ€™s Role:</strong> Engineers must remain vigilant and ethical, understanding the broader implications of the tools they develop.</li>
                </ul>
